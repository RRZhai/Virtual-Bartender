# Phase 1 Table 5 Project: Flatiron Virtual Bartender
## PROJECT INFO:
Flatiron Virtual Bartender is a single page JavaScript application intended to allow users to seach/find a wide variety of drinks (both with and without alcohol) they can make with the ingredients in their home. To do this the application allows a user to search by either the name of a drink or by a specific ingredient. Users are then able to filter the results with clickable filter options. The results are placed into a scrollable list, that on clicking a drink presents the user with a full ingredient list as well as how to make the drink. This project uses JavaScript and CSS to interact with HTML
